# HelloWorldCOBOL
A silly program to print "Hello World" to the user in COBOL. A fun experiment.
To run, simply type this command on the command line "./helloworld" to run the executable. 
Learned about COBOL's pickiness for indentation, which some programmers could use nowadays. 
For those wanting to learn COBOL, you build an executable with this command :
cobc -free -x -o ExecutableName FileName.cob
-x builds the executable, -o says to put in the file proceeding, and -free says to use free source format.
